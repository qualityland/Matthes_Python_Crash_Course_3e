# 04-15. Code Review:
# Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter and modify
# each one to comply with PEP 8.
# - Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to
#   insert four spaces every time you press the TAB key, if you haven’t
#   already done so (see Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
# - Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to
#   show a vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
# - Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files.
