# 03-10. Every Function:
# Think of things you could store in a list. For example, you could make a list
# of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d
# like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items and then uses
# each function introduced in this chapter at least once.
