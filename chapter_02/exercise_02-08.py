# 02-08. File Extensions:
# Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix().
# Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename.
# Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the
# file extension, like some file browsers do.
file_name = 'python_notes.txt'
